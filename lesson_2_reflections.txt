What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
	Creates empty repository. No commits made. Need to make intial commit.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
	Staging area holds files that have been "added" but haven't been sent to actual repository. This could allow you to hold a version that your are not quite ready to commit and allow you to continue making changes to workign directory.
